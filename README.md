# Functional_Clustering

This package implements a semi-supervised functional clustering model for spatial proteomics data. Our approach is designed for leveraging the small labeled subset to guide learning while extracting structure from the abundant unlabeled data. This makes the method especially useful when full annotation is costly or impractical. 

The main motivating application is a novel subcellular proteome dataset from the model diatom \textit{Thalassiosira pseudonana} (CCMP1335) using differential centrifugation.
